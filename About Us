Menstrual Hygiene is every women's right. Team Excess 3, was moved deeply looking at the plight of women who couldn't afford a packet of sanity pads. If she can bring  precious life to this world, can we help and make her life  a little easier?  We thought of bringing a small change- Sponsor a packet of pads and bring a smile on her face. Our vision is simple, every women deserves free menstrual hygiene products. If we come together, to participate in this revolution maybe we can actually change the World.
